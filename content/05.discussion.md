## Discussion

*Cucurbita pepo*, *Cucurbita moschata*, and *Cucurbita maxima*, 
exhibit a wide range of phenotypic diversity.
This deversity was evident in the GRIN phenotypic records for these species.
We have demonstrated that there is a wide range of genetic deveresity through
genotyping-by-sequencing and genetic analysis of available specimens from 
the germplasm collections. Thousands to tens of thousands of whole-genome markers
where obtained for each species. Clustering of samples and admixture analysis
produced results that align closely with known secondary centers of origin in all species. 
This was especially clear in our analysis of the *Cucurbita pepo* collection.
*Cucurbita pepo* has its origin in the new world, with a secondary center of
diversification in Europe. This pattern was conspicuous in the our PCA analysis.  
Phylogenetic anlaysis of *Cucurbita pepo* using the whole-genome
markers also supported the known relationships between the various subspecies in *pepo*. 
Together with the mapping of a putative bush gene (*Bu*) that appears to be syntenic 
with the bush gene mapped in *C. maxima*, we have demonstrated that these data 
constitute a new, high quality genetic resource for the Cucurbit community. 
These markers and our analysis of available germplasm
have a number of uses for breeding and can also be used to guide future experments
aimed at biological insight.

From a breeding perspective, these data can be used to develop germplasm
specific marker panels for use in breeding applications, as has been done in
other crops {@doi:10.1186/s12284-019-0311-0}.
Possible breeding applications would  include marker assisted selection, 
marker assisted backcrossing, and purity assessment of seedstock using a low density panel; 
whereas, a medium density panel could be developed for routine genomic selection.  Our clustering
of samples based on maker data suggest geography is a key driver for overall population 
structure. When projecting ancestry proportions onto cultivars of known market classes, the ancestry 
proportions were relatively similar within market class grouping. Alghough there is genetic diversity 
within each species, this diversity is constrained within market classes. This suggests that
crosses between these market classes would greatly increase the amount of genetic diversity 
to be leveraged in breeding efforts. Crossing between market classes would come at 
the cost of bringing in undesirable characteristics with regards to achieving a specific 
morpho-type associated market class. This cost could be mitgated through the use of
markers to recover morpho-type expediciously during pre-breeding.

Subsets of the germplasm available and markers
can also be used to for developement of custom  populations, in the
case of where rare is in the panel, or  . Adoption could also enable 
different breeding strategies in Cucurbits.



Unlike many other outcrossing monoicous crops such as, maize and onion, cultivars from Cucurbita, 
similar to sunflower, do not suffer from debilatating inbreeding depression resulting in a 
severe reduction in vigor and fertility (Whitaker and Davis, 1962). 
With little inbreeding depression, it would stand that little better-parent heterosis could 
be achieved considering the dominance theory of heterosis. 
There  were initial papers that suggested that inbreeding in Cucurbita may not simply reduce 
yeild as inbred varieties have the capacity to compete with commercial check cultivars;
however, better-parent heterosis has been observed in a Cucurbita pepo and C
ucurbita maxima (Firpo et. al., 1998). 
Although better-parent heterosis has been observed, inbred cultivars remain competitive 
with there hybrid counter-parts. 
It has been suggested that the oddity of Cucurbita not suffering high levels of 
inbreeding depression is the result of an archaic population bottleneck. 
The population bottleneck would effectively lead to greater levels of population 
homogeneity through many variants in the initial population being lost and the 
low-frequency alleles post-bottleneck having a greater probability of becoming lost. 

It is commonplace for breeders in many crops to breed within market-classes, 
that is, make crosses between cultivars that are destined for similar culinary uses. 
Leveraging elite varieties as parents is foundational in creating superior cultivars; 
however, a delicate balance must be achieved between maintaining elite level genetics 
and genetic diversity. With more breeding programs beginning to adopt genomic 
selection/prediction, the rate of genetic gain has increased by virtue of a reduced 
time interval between selections. The introduction of diversity into elite germplasm 
pools is critical for long term gain as the diversity of the breeding populations become
exhausted after many generations of selection. Genomic selection ultimately allows for 
faster integration of diverse breeding material into elite germplasm while continueing 
to purge deleterious alleles found in said diversity. Although challenging, inter-specific 
crosses have been leveraged in squash to transfer major disease resistance loci to great effect; 
however, potentially powerful quantitave loci lag behind in cross species integration. 
A potential key in successful integration is correct evaluation of genetic relationship as 
the accessibility of advantagious diversity may rely on the genetic proximity of parental lines.
