## Introduction

The *Cucurbitaceae* (Cucurbit) family is home to a number of vining species 
mostly cultivated for their fruits. This diverse and economically important 
family includes cucumber (*Cucumis sativa*), melon (*Cucumis melo*), 
watermelon (*Citrullus lanatus*), and squash (*Cucurbita ssp.*) 
[@doi:10.1007/978-0-387-30443-4_10]. Like other cucurbits, squash exhibit 
diversity in growth habit, fruit morphology, metabolite content, disease 
resistance, and have a nuanced domestication story 
[@doi:10.21273/HORTSCI.40.6.1620; @doi:10/gsg7]. 
The genomes of *Cucurbita ssp.* are 
small (roughly 500 Mb), but result from complex interactions between ancient
genomes brought together through an allopolyploidization event
[@doi:10.1016/j.molp.2017.09.003]. These factors make squash an excellent model for 
understanding the biology of genomes, fruit development, and domestication.
Within *Cucurbita*, five species are recognized as domesticated. 
Three of these are broadlycultivated: *Cucurbita maxima*, *Cucurbita moschata*, 
and *Cucurbita pepo* [@doi:10.1007/978-0-387-30443-4_10]. 
Few genomic resources have been 
available for working with these species; although, draft genomes and 
annotations, along with  web-based tools and other genomics data are 
emerging [@doi:10.1093/nar/gky944]. Already, these resources have been used to 
elucidate the genetics of fruit quality, growth habit, disease resistance, and 
to increase the efficiency of cucurbit improvement 
[@doi:10.1186/s12864-016-3439-y; @doi:10.1038/s41598-017-13216-3; 
@doi:10.1007/s11032-018-0869-z; @doi:10.3835/plantgenome2018.10.0082; 
@doi:10.1038/s41438-019-0176-9; @doi:10.1534/g3.120.401215]; however, there has yet to be a 
comprehensive survey of the genetic diversity in large diverse *Cucurbita* 
germplasm panels, such as those maintained by the USDA within the Germplasm 
Resources Information Network (GRIN) system.

Germplasm collections play a vital role in maintaining and preserving 
genetic variation. These collections can be mined by breeders for valuable 
alleles and can also be used by geneticists and biologists 
for mapping studies [@doi:10.1016/j.molp.2020.08.011]. Like many other orphan and
specialty crops,there has been little effort put into developing community genetic
resources for squash and other cucurbits.
The Cucurbit Coordinated Agricultural Project (CucCap project) was established 
to help close the knowledge gap in Cucurbits. This collaborative project aims to 
provide genomics resources and tools that can aid in both applied breeding and basic 
research. The genetic and phenotypic diversity present in the USDA watermelon and cucumber 
collections has already been explored as part of the CucCap project, partially
through the sequencing of USDA germplasm collections and development of core collections for 
whole-genome sequencing [@doi:10.1038/s41438-018-0080-8; @doi:10.1111/pbi.13136].
The diverse specimens of the USDA squash collections have yet to be well characterized at the genetic level; 
although, an elaborate system has been established for classifying squash based
on species and various other characteristics.
	
The classification system used in squash is complex. Squash from each species can be 
classed as winter or summer squash depending on whether the fruit is consumed at an 
immature or mature stage, the latter is a winter squash [@doi:abs/10.1080/07352680490490733]. 
Squash are considered ornamental if they are used for decoration, and some irregularly shaped, 
inedible ornamental squash are called gourds; however, gourds include members of *Cucurbita* 
as well as some species from *Lagenaria*---not all gourds are squash 
[@doi:10.1007/s10681-015-1605-y]. Many squash are known as pumpkins; 
the pumpkin designation is aculture dependent colloquialism that can refer to jack O' lantern types,
squash used for desserts or, in some Latin American countries, to eating squash from *C. moschata* 
known locally as Calabaza [@doi:10.1007/978-0-387-30443-4_10]. Cultivars deemed as pumpkins can be 
found in all widely cultivated squash species. Unlike the previous groupings, morophotypes/market 
classes are defined within species.For example, a Zucchini is reliably a member of *C. pepo* and a 
Buttercups are from *C. maxima*. Adding to the complexity of their classification, the *Cucurbita* 
species are believed to have arisen from independent domestication events and the 
relationships between cultivated and wild species remains poorly understood [@doi:10.1016/j.ympev.2017.03.002].
	
*C. pepo* is the most economically important of the *Cucurbita* species
and is split into two different subspecies: *C. pepo* subsp. *pepo* 
and *C. pepo* subsp. *ovifera* [@doi:10.1038/s41438-019-0176-9]. Evidence points 
to Mexico as the center of origin for *pepo* and southwest/central United States 
as the origin of *ovifera*. The progenitor of *ovifera* is considered by some 
to be subsp. *ovifera* var. *texana*, whereas subsp. *fraterna* 
is a candidate progenitor for *pepo* [@doi:10.1016/j.ympev.2017.03.002]. Europe played a 
crucial role as a secondary center of diversification for *pepo*, but not 
*ovifera* [@doi:10.1093/aob/mcw080]. Important morphoptypes of *pepo* 
include  Zucchini, Spaghetti squash, Cocozelle, Vegetable marrow, and some 
ornamental pumpkins. *C. pepo* subsp. *ovifera* includes summer 
squash from the Crookneck, Scallop, and Straightneck group, and winter squash 
such as Delicata and Acorn [@doi:10.1007/s12231-012-9186-3]. 
	
The origin of *C. moschata* is more uncertain than *C. pepo*; 
it is unclear whether *C. moschata* has a South or North American origin 
[@doi:10.1111/nph.16015]. Where and when domestication occurred for this species is 
also unknown; however it is known that *C. moschata* had an India-Myanmar 
secondary center of origin where the species was further diversified [@doi:10.1016/j.molp.2017.09.003]. 
*C. moschata* plays an important role in squash breeding as it cross-fertile to 
various degrees with *C. pepo* and *C. maxima*, and can thus be used as a bridge 
to move genes across species  [@doi:10.1016/j.molp.2017.09.003]. Popular market classes 
of *C. moschata* include Cheese types like Dickenson, which is widely used 
for canned pumpkin products, Butternut (neck) types, Japonica, and tropical 
pumpkins known as Calabaza [@doi:10.1007/978-0-387-30443-4_10].
	
*C. maxima* contains many popular winter squash including Buttercup/Kobocha 
types, Kuri, Hubbard, and Banana squash [@doi: @doi:10.1007/978-0-387-30443-4_10]. This 
species also sports the world's largest fruit, the giant pumpkin whose fruit are grown for 
competition and can reach well over 1000 Kg [@doi:10.1111/pce.12502]. Although this 
species exhibits a wide range of phenotypic diversity in terms of fruit characteristics, 
it appears to be the least genetically diverse of the three species described 
[@doi:10.1016/j.ympev.2017.03.002]. *C. maxima* is believed to have a South American origin, 
and was likely domesticated near Peru, with a secondary center of 
domestication in Japan/China [nee_domestication_1990; @doi:10.1016/j.molp.2017.09.003].

 In this study, we set out to characterize the genetic diversity present in 
 the USDA *Cucurbita* germplasm collections for *C. pepo*, *C. moschata*, 
 and *C. maxima*. We present genotyping-by-sequencing data from each of these 
 collections, population genomics analysis, results from genome-wide association 
 using historical and contemporary phenotypes, and develop a core panel for re-sequencing.
