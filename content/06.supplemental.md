## Supplemental  Figures

![Cross-validation error  plots used to pick the optimum K value for admixture analysis. The K value that minimizes cross-validation error, and thus chosen for the final analysis, is labeled with a red point.](images/error_plots.png) {#fig:cv}

![Results from running GenoCore in each of the panels. Panel A shows the PCA plots for each panel with accessions selected by GenoCore represented as black points. Panel B shows the proportion of total accessions needed to obtain a certain coverage of diversity.](images/core_plot.png) {#fig:core}
